Custom MacPorts Ports
=====================

This is a tree of custom ports for MacPorts.

Currently, I have only modified the `perl` ports and added a `perl_select` port for easier Perl version management.

##### Bugs/TODOs #####

* The file lists `${PORTIDR}/files/perl${branch}` for Perl 5.8 and 5.10 are not necessarily correct: they have not been verified
* The manpages are not included in any of the file lists.
